## Sources and Uses

The source and use of 3rd party materials in the creation of this **Markdown** page is greatly appreciated.

Most authors and publishers will allow for the abbreviated reproduction of their works in part when the case of brief quotations or ideas embodied in critical articles or reviews becomes necessary to further the understanding of the end-user's learning process, and to help subsequently clarify the original thoughts the author is attempting to convey.

Indeed, ping-backs to original sources are welcome by the readers, the authors, and the publishers of instructional hard copies.

Therefore, it is the policy of the MMINAIL [[1](#MMINAIL){:.red}] to always provide a **Ping Back** to the original author, or to the publisher of the original publication when citing 3rd party work.

**Note**. Please support the authors and publishers who aggregate the **Source Links** for our projects.
